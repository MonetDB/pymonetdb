Introduction
============

pymonetdb is a native python client API for monetDB. This API is cross-platform,
and doesn't depend on any monetdb libraries. It has support for python 2.7,
Python 3 and PyPy. The driver is also Python DBAPI 2.0 compatible.

Please note, this is now the official MonetDB Python API. It should be a
drop-in replacement for python-monetdb. Just change `import monetdb` statements
into `import pymonetdb` in your project.
