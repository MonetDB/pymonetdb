======================
The MonetDB Python API
======================

pymonetdb is the native Python client API for monetDB. It is cross-platform
and does not depend on any MonetDB libraries.  It supports
Python 3.6+ and PyPy and is Python `DBAPI 2.0`_ compatible.

.. _`DBAPI 2.0`: https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/

Besides the functionality required by DBAPI 2.0, pymonetdb also provides some
MonetDB-specific functionality, in particular file transfers. These are detailed
in the API section.
